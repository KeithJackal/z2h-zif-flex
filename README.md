# Flex cable design for the Zune 80 and 120 media player!

Reverse engineered based on the real cable with minor differences. The goal is to offer a free to use board file for those who want to get some replacements manufactured by PCB fab companies like JLCPCB or PCBWay! 


> **UNTESTED!** The prototype cables have not arrived and therefore the design is UNTESTED. Any changes will be uploaded so keep an eye out!
